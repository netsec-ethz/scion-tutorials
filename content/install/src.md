# Building from sources (Linux)

If you are planning to make modifications to the SCION implementation, you can build SCION from sources and run your SCIONLab AS with your own version of SCION.
For developers' convenience, SCIONLab supports generating configurations that are compatible with the scripts and machinery intended to run SCION in a development environment.

Building SCION from sources requires following a lengthy setup procedure and installing various development dependencies.
The development setup is currently supported/documented for **Ubuntu 16.04 or Ubuntu 18.04**.
It is possible to build SCION on other systems, but no guidance is provided. To keep it simple, just run Ubuntu in a VM or container if you can't/don't want to set it up on your workstation.

Please follow the instructions in the [GitHub README](https://github.com/netsec-ethz/scion/) to clone and build SCION.

{% include alert type="note" content="
SCIONLab runs a version of SCION built from the branch `scionlab` in netsec-ethz/scion.
This branch (intentionally) lags behind the scionproto/scion master. As there are still (rarely) breaking changes in the SCION protocol, running `master` may or may not be compatible with `scionlab`.
" %}

{% include alert type="Tip" content="
If you only want to develop applications _using_ SCION, you may still rely on the convenience of our [pre-built binary packages](../install/pkg.html).

The [scion-apps](https://github.com/netsec-ethz/scion-apps/) repository contains examples for applications that run
on top of SCION.

## Configuration

After having managed to build SCION and after [creating or modifying your AS](../config/create_as.html) in the SCIONLab coordination website, you can deploy the generated configuration to your machine.

1. Download the configuration tarfile from the SCIONLab coordination website.
2. If you plan on using a VPN, unpack the `client-scionlab-<attachment point ISD-AS>.conf` to `/etc/openvpn/` and start OpenVPN
   ```shell
   sudo systemctl restart openvpn@client-scionlab-<attachment point ISD-AS>
   ```
3. Extract the `gen/` subdirectory to your `$SC` directory.
4. Restart SCION
   ```shell
   cd $SC
   scion.sh stop
   supervisor/supervisor.sh reload  # necessary if supervisor.conf files changed
   scion.sh start
   ```

{% include alert type="note" content="
The configuration installed with the `scionlab-config` script as used in the [packaged installation](../install/pkg.html#configuration) is *not* directly compatible
with `supervisord` and the `scion.sh` machinery.
" %}


## Running SCION

To build, start and stop SCION, use the `scion.sh` developer script, located in the SCION repository.

```shell
cd $SC
scion.sh start          # Build and start SCION services
scion.sh start nobuild  # Start, without building
scion.sh status         # Lists failed SCION services
scion.sh stop           # Stop all SCION services
```

The commands above are essentially a wrapper around supervisord.
Alternatively, use the supervisor commands directly, using the `supervisor/supervisor.sh` helper script.
```shell
cd $SC
supervisor/supervisor.sh reload   # Reload supervisord configuration
supervisor/supervisor.sh status   # Show status of all SCION services
supervisor/supervisor.sh          # Starts the supervisor shell
```
