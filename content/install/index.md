# Installation: Available options

SCIONLab supports three main options to run the SCION services that make up a SCION AS

1.  [Run a virtual machine](../install/vm.md)

    The simplest option to get started and is supported on all platforms that can run Vagrant and VirtualBox. Inside the Ubuntu VM, the SCION installation uses packages (the same as described in the next step).

2.  [Install with a package manager](../install/pkg.md)

    Applicable to any Debian-based systems for the most common CPU platforms. Painless installation procedure and no performance overhead from running a VM.

3.  [Build from sources](../install/src.md)

    Use this option if you want to make modifications to the SCION services. Requires following lengthy instructions and installing various development dependencies. 

Additionally, you can [build and run SCION on Android](../install/android.md).
