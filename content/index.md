## Running SCION infrastructure in a VM

The easiest way to run SCION is by running a preconfigured SCION Virtual Machine on a commodity OS (MacOS, Windows). The following tutorials are covering the necessary steps.

* [1) Running SCION VM over OpenVPN](virtual_machine_setup/dynamic_ip.md)
* [2) Running SCION VM with static public IP](virtual_machine_setup/static_ip.md)

## Configuring SCION infrastructure manually

The following tutorials cover how to install, configure, and run a SCION infrastructure in a step-by-step manner on a dedicated host (without a VM).

### 1. Installing SCION on different platforms:

* [3) Installing SCION on Ubuntu 16.04 x86](native_setup/ubuntu_x86_build.md)
* [4) Installing SCION on Ubuntu MATE 16.04 - Raspberry PI](native_setup/rpi_ubuntu.md)
* [5) Installing SCION on ARM minicomputers using prebuilt images](native_setup/image_builder.md)
* [6) Installing SCION on an Android device](native_setup/android.md)

### 2. Setting up SCION topology

* [Configuring local topology](general_scion_configuration/local_top.md)
